# Implementation Plan

## Validation Checklist

### CRITICAL GATES (Must Pass)

- [x] All `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers have been addressed
- [x] All specification file paths are correct and exist
- [x] Each phase follows TDD: Prime → Test → Implement → Validate
- [x] Every task has verifiable success criteria
- [x] A developer could follow this plan independently

### QUALITY CHECKS (Should Pass)

- [x] Context priming section is complete
- [x] All implementation phases are defined with linked phase files
- [x] Dependencies between phases are clear (no circular dependencies)
- [x] Parallel work is properly tagged with `[parallel: true]`
- [x] Activity hints provided for specialist selection `[activity: type]`
- [x] Every phase references relevant SDD sections
- [x] Every test references PRD acceptance criteria
- [x] Integration & E2E tests defined in final phase
- [x] Project commands match actual project setup

## Context Priming

*GATE: Read all files in this section before starting any implementation.*

**Specification**:

- `.start/specs/003-custom-time-entry/requirements.md` - Product Requirements
- `.start/specs/003-custom-time-entry/solution.md` - Solution Design

**Key Design Decisions**:

- **ADR-1**: Parameter name `start_time` — optional ISO 8601 datetime string with offset support
- **ADR-2**: UTC normalization via `new Date(input)` — standard JS Date constructor handles offset conversion
- **ADR-3**: No changes to ClockodoClient — only `src/tools/add-entry.ts` is modified

**Implementation Context**:

```bash
# Testing
npm test                    # Unit tests (vitest)

# Quality
npm run lint               # Linting with fix
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript type checking

# Build
npm run build              # TypeScript compilation
```

## Implementation Phases

Each phase is defined in a separate file. Tasks follow red-green-refactor: **Prime** (understand context), **Test** (red), **Implement** (green), **Validate** (refactor + verify).

> **Tracking Principle**: Track logical units that produce verifiable outcomes. The TDD cycle is the method, not separate tracked items.
